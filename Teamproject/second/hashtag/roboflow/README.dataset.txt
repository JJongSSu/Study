# About This Dataset

The Roboflow `Thermal Dogs and People` dataset is a collection of 203 thermal infrared images captured at various distances from people and dogs in a park and near a home. Some images are deliberately unannotated as they do not contain a person or dog (see the Dataset Health Check for more). Images were captured both portrait and landscape. (Roboflow `auto-orient` assures the annotations align regardless of the image orientation.)

Thermal images were captured using the Seek Compact XR Extra Range Thermal Imaging Camera for iPhone. The selected color palette is Spectra.

## Example

This is an example image and annotation from the dataset:

## Usage

Thermal images have a wide array of applications: monitoring machine performance, seeing in low light conditions, and adding another dimension to standard RGB scenarios. Infrared imaging is useful in security, wildlife detection,and hunting / outdoors recreation.

This dataset serves as a way to experiment with infrared images in Roboflow. (Or, you could build your own night time pet finder!)
